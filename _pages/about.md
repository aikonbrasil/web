When I finished my master degree program 12 years ago, I was not able to match many subjective definitions from the academy on the industrial world. So, many ideas and definitions were only suitable for books and academic references. For this reason, I took advantage of a chance to take a look onto industry. This short chance to take a look the real world lasted more than 10 years. Now, many questions were solved and now I come back to academy to get in touch with mathematical models and tecnologies that are leading 5G and Beyond wireless generation. For this reason, now I can say that my view of joined point between academy and industry is more comprehensive than before.


A brief Biography
======
I am an Engineer with experience on Wireless Communication by more than 15 years. All this time was shared between academy and industry. In my Master I worked with OFDM and non-linear systems, and now in my PhD I am studying GFDM, Grant-free access, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, and cell-free massive MIMO.

My bachelor in Electronic Engineering was done in San Marcos National University, in Lima, Per√∫. My Master degree in Electrical Engineering was done in the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
