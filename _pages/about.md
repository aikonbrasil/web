<div style="text-align: justify"> 
When I finished my master degree program 12 years ago, I was not able to match many subjective definitions from the academy on the industrial world. So, many ideas and definitions were only suitable for books and academic references. However, most of them did not match with the real world. For this reason, I was taking a look outside this amazing bubble that lasted more than 10 years.

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Now, many questions are clarified and after 10 years I am coming back to academy. The idea is to complement my industry experience with amazing mathematical models and tecnologies that are leading 5G and Beyond wireless generation. For this reason, I can say that my view of the encounter point between academy and industry is today more comprehensive than before.
