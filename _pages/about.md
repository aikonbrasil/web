A brief Biography
======
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
My name is Dick Carrillo Melgarejo, and welcome to my CV page. I am an Engineer with experience on Wireless Communication by more than 18 years. All this time was shared between the academy and industry. In my Master's, I worked with OFDM and non-linear systems, and now, in my Ph.D., I proposed a RAN Slicing Framework based on Machine Learning to enable IEC 61850 (a power grid substation protocol). My interest research topics are OFDM, GFDM, Grant-free access, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, cell-free massive MIMO, and machine learning applications on wireless communication.
