When I finished my master degree program 12 years ago, I was not able to match many subjective definitions from the academy on the industrial world. So, many ideas and definitions were only suitable for books and academic references. However, I was not able to match them with the real world. For this reason, I was taking a look outside this amazing bubble that lasted more than 10 years.

Now, many questions are clarified and after 10 years I am coming back to academy. The idea is to complement my industry experience with amazing mathematical models and tecnologies that are leading 5G and Beyond wireless generation. For this reason, I can say that my view of the encounter point between academy and industry is today more comprehensive than before.
