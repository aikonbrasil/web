***Abstract:*** Most of the edge research in wireless communication is based on theory studies. It is extremely difficult to model a truly wireless communication as it is happening in the real world. However, there are very well accurated mathematical models that aims to represent some specific scenarios. 

Fading Multipath Channels
=======

To characterize the time-variant multipath channel statistically. So, let us examine the effects of the channel on a transmitted signal that is represented as
