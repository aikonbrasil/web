In every communication network, the transport layer plays a fundamental rule. Usually these communication networks are a conjunction of many networks. In parallel, some protocols, such as IEC-61850 transport specific messages with special requirements. For instance, SV message is transmitted on L2 in order to increase latency using in most of the cases UDP packages. For this setup, it is mandatory to create specific tunnels at L2. One option to handle this type of tunnels is Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE).
