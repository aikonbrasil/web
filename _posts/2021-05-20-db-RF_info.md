***Abstract:*** In order to document the experience of gathering RF information from a real dataset comming from a real 4G (pre-5G) network, I am sharing some key steps used on this experiment, most of them related to Data Base Setup.

Data Base Setup
=======

Creating the DB platform
-------

The main reference is coming from this [ArchLinux documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/MariaDB){}

1. ```sh
sudo pacman -S mariadb
```

2. ```sh
sudo mariadb-install-db --user=mysql --basedir=/usr --datadir=/var/lib/mysql
```

3. ```sh
sudo systemctl enable mariadb.service
``` 

4. ```sh
sudo systemctl start mariadb.service
``` 


Creating the DB table
-------

1. ```sh
sudo mysql -u root -p
```
Note: to simplify, I have used a blank password for the db root user, it is the default one, however, you can set up another one. 

2. Create the database `RFINFO`
```sh
create database RFINFO;
```

3. Provide grant access to user lut on `RFINFO` database
```sh
grant all privileges on RFINFO.* TO 'lut'@'%';
grant all privileges on RFINFO.* TO 'lut'@'%' identified by 'lut';
flush privileges;
```

4. Create the table and column label for the database
```python
CREATE TABLE information( id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, device_id VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, RSRP TINYINT SIGNED, RSRQ TINYINT SIGNED, RSSI TINYINT SIGNED, SINR TINYINT SIGNED, ts_remote TIMESTAMP, ts_local  TIMESTAMP, PRIMARY KEY (id) );
```

5. To show the content of the database. In some cases it is necessarily to indicate the name of the database to check with the command `USE RFINFO;`
```
show tables;
SELECT * FROM information;
```

6. Only in case the user is interested to delete data saved in the database, run the following command
```
DELETE from information 
```
