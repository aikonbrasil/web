Some energy system applications, as electricity grid protection, requires a communication network with very low latency and high reliability. Although a lot of discussions and research about ultra-reliability and low latency is going on in the communication engineering community, the energy system engineers do not share the same confidence in relation to what 5G can actually deliver. So, based on previous concern, The objective of these paper is to present our vision related to the potential technologies that will support energy system applications in upcoming wireless generations beyond 5G. Our position is based on the application of a flexible GFDM waveform in physical layer, hybrid multiple access technique, and new development in SDR to support future technologies together with specific network architecture to enable energy system applications.
