excerpt: 'In this letter, we consider the minimum mean-square error receiver for the generalized frequency division multiplexing system (GFDM) over frequency selective fading channels. We derive an approximate probability density function for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. This expression allows us to obtain a new approximate, but rather accurate formulation for the bit error probability for a M-quadrature amplitude modulation scheme. Our results resort on the pivotal properties exhibited by eigenvalues of a circulant matrix. Since the entries of the channel matrix H ch are complex Gaussian distributed, and the eigenvalues are given as a weighted sum of its entries, the joint eigenvalue distribution is also Gaussian. Comparisons of the simulated and analytical results validate our formulation and allow a quick and efficient tool to compute the bit error rate for the GFDM system.'

In this letter, we consider the minimum mean-square error receiver for the generalized frequency division multiplexing system (GFDM) over frequency selective fading channels. We derive an approximate probability density function for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. This expression allows us to obtain a new approximate, but rather accurate formulation for the bit error probability for a M-quadrature amplitude modulation scheme. Our results resort on the pivotal properties exhibited by eigenvalues of a circulant matrix. Since the entries of the channel matrix H ch are complex Gaussian distributed, and the eigenvalues are given as a weighted sum of its entries, the joint eigenvalue distribution is also Gaussian. Comparisons of the simulated and analytical results validate our formulation and allow a quick and efficient tool to compute the bit error rate for the GFDM system.
