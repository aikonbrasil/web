    1. What is meant by collaborative learning, self-regulation and co-regulation?

    - Collaborative Learning: How a group in social interaction create joint objectives for learning aims for these objectives via discussions and negotiations, and are all committed to these objectives as well as motivated to achieve them. It is not efficienty per se. It should use efficient learning mechanisms (asking questions, providing explanations, sharing knowledge, argumentation, taking a perspective, and following others' working strategies) such as social interaction can launch deep learning processes in individuals.

    - Self-regulation: is central for ones learning. It is extremely important strategic skill that one should master already in basic education. Thus self-regulation is something we need to give attention starting already from the first grade. Self-regulation of learning refers to processes where one has a plan for this or her learning and studying, and monitors and evaluates his or her learning processes during the task. All these aspects should be continuous activity regardless are the one working as part of group or individually. One should set goals and sub-goals, follow and evaluate the strategies used: are the ones I'm using reasonable?. Do they help me to achieve my learning goals? Should I change or develop them during  the task ?. One should also constantly monitor and evaluate whether the main or sub-goals have been achieved, and should them be changed?. In collaborative learning, it is important that one is able to regulate one's own working process in relation to the group.

    - Co-regulation: It is also crucial that an individual is able to participate to co-regulation of the collaborative work. Thus, groups should reflect their shared interests: If I am interested in particular theme, how could it be connected to the theme we are interested in as a group?, what do we want to achieve as a group?, how can we make sure that our individual learning goals will be met?. During the process both, the group and the individual should reflect the joint progression: are we moving towards our common goals?, do we  understand each other? , do we have a mutual understanding about the concepts we use?, do we  have a shared understanding about our objectives?, do our commong strategies work or should we change them during the task. In the end, it is important to reflect how we do as a group: Did we achieve the shared learning objectives?, How shall we work together in the future?, what were the reasons for failing to meet the objectives?, What aspects effected our results and how can we take them in concern in the future?. 


2. EXTRA:
=====

The role of technology for supporting peoples learning. There is strong evidence that -at its best- technology can support collaborative learning. It can provide flexible and versatile tools for collaborative between the members of the group. But also to support the learning process of individuals. For example, technology can offer means for monitoring one's own learning processes, archiving and modifying of information, sharing and distributing one's knowledge and expertise. Today, the importance of technology in learning processes is undeniable, but one must always reflect why and how technology should be used?, How will it benefit learning processes?. will it support the learning of the group or an individual?
