***Abstract:*** In the last years many AIML applications are getting popular, most of them are constrained to computer simulations without any hardware implication. In this case, the target is to get in touch with Nvidia hardware for a potential run-up on real applications, for example robotics.

By now, the Nvidia-Nano-2B is already waiting for the next components, such as cooler and a microSD-card. In addition, the plan is to buy a raspberry cam (Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2) to do an basic image application. 

[Nvidia-Nano-2G](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-2gb-devkit) outdated information, but still valid. The hardware is not anymore available, but the intention is to buy later an advanved version, such as these new [Nano boards](https://developer.nvidia.com/buy-jetson?product=all&location=FI).

[Reference Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BneqPdEhMM) here there is a basic good reference to follow.
